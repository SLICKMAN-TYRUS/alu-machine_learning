# Advanced Linear Algebra

This project covers advanced concepts in linear algebra including determinants, minors, cofactors, adjugates, matrix inverses, and matrix definiteness.

## Tasks

### 0. Determinant
Function that calculates the determinant of a matrix using cofactor expansion.

### 1. Minor
Function that calculates the minor matrix of a matrix.

### 2. Cofactor
Function that calculates the cofactor matrix of a matrix by applying the checkerboard pattern of signs to the minor matrix.

### 3. Adjugate
Function that calculates the adjugate (adjoint) matrix, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.

### 4. Inverse
Function that calculates the inverse of a matrix using the formula: A^(-1) = adj(A) / det(A).

### 5. Definiteness
Function that determines if a matrix is positive definite, positive semi-definite, negative definite, negative semi-definite, or indefinite based on its eigenvalues.

## Requirements
- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15 (for task 5 only)
- pycodestyle 2.5
