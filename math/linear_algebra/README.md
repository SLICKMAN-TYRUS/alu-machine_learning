# Linear Algebra

This project focuses on fundamental linear algebra concepts using Python and NumPy.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General
- What is a vector?
- What is a matrix?
- What is a transpose?
- What is the shape of a matrix?
- What is an axis?
- What is a slice?
- How do you slice a vector/matrix?
- What are element-wise operations?
- How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
- What is the dot product?
- What is matrix multiplication?
- What is Numpy?
- What is parallelization and why is it important?
- What is broadcasting?
